# ebade Roadmap 🗺️

> Building the first framework designed FOR AI agents - The Essence of Code.

---

## 🎯 Vision

**ebade** becomes the native language for AI agents to build web applications.
When a user asks an AI to "build me an e-commerce site", the AI speaks ebade.
It's more efficient, deterministic, and KIND TO EARTH. 🌱

- [ ] Real-time compilation preview
- [ ] Share ebade via URL

### 2.3 Documentation Site

- [ ] "The Turkish Story" - The meaning of ebade
- [ ] Getting started for Agents
- [ ] Getting started for Humans

## Phase 3: Ecosystem (Month 2)

### 3.1 ebade Registry

## Success Metrics (3 Months)

| Metric | Target | Current | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Token Savings | >70% | ~70% | ✅ |
| Carbon Saved | >100kg | TBD | 🔄 |
| Framework Targets | 3 | 1 | 🔄 |
| Community Size | 1,000 "Badiks" | 0 | 🔜 |

---

## Current Status

### Phase 1 - Foundation ✅ (v0.3.0 - The Testing Era)

The MCP server is live and fully synced. CLI has premium UX and now generates **production-ready code** with Tailwind CSS and automatic Unit Testing (Vitest). AI agents can now use ebade to scaffold full Next.js apps with **~80% fewer tokens** while maintaining high code quality through TDD.
