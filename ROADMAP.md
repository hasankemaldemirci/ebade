# ebade Roadmap 🗺️

> Building the first framework designed FOR AI agents - The Essence of Code.

---

## 🎯 Vision

**ebade** becomes the native language for AI agents to build web applications.
When a user asks an AI to "build me an e-commerce site", the AI speaks ebade.
It's more efficient, deterministic, and KIND TO EARTH. 🌱

---

## Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1-2) ✅ COMPLETE

### 1.1 MCP Server ✅

Make ebade usable by AI agents RIGHT NOW.

- [x] Create MCP server package
- [x] `ebade_scaffold` tool - generate project from ebade
- [x] `ebade_validate` tool - validate ebade file
- [x] `ebade_compile` tool - compile single ebade to code
- [x] `ebade_generate` tool - infer ebade from natural language

### 1.2 CLI Premium Experience ✅

- [x] ASCII Art logo on startup
- [x] Spinner animations for progress
- [x] Statistics summary (files, token savings, time)
- [x] "Generated via ebade" headers in all output files

### 1.3 Examples & Templates ✅

- [x] E-commerce template (193 lines)
- [x] SaaS Dashboard template (300 lines, multi-tenant, billing, team management)

### 1.4 Real Compiler (In Progress)

Replace string templates with actual AST-based compilation.

- [ ] ebade parser (YAML/TS → AST)
- [ ] Code generator (AST → React/Next.js)
- [ ] Support for multiple framework targets

### 1.5 CLI Improvements ✅

- [x] `ebade init` - interactive project setup
- [x] `ebade dev` - watch mode with local agent sync

---

## Phase 2: Developer Experience (Week 3-4)

### 2.1 VS Code Extension

- [ ] Syntax highlighting for ebade decorators
- [ ] Autocomplete for inferred patterns
- [ ] Inline token usage counter (Carbon counter! 🌱)

### 2.2 Playground Website

- [ ] Live editor (Monaco)
- [ ] Real-time compilation preview
- [ ] Share ebade via URL

### 2.3 Documentation Site

- [ ] "The Turkish Story" - The meaning of ebade
- [ ] Getting started for Agents
- [ ] Getting started for Humans

---

## Phase 3: Ecosystem (Month 2)

### 3.1 ebade Registry

- [ ] npm-like registry for reusable intents
- [ ] `ebade add auth/clerk`
- [ ] `ebade add blog/minimal`

### 3.2 Framework Targets

- [x] Next.js App Router ✅ (v0.1)
- [ ] Vue 3 + Nuxt
- [ ] Svelte + SvelteKit
- [ ] Mobile (React Native / Flutter)

### 3.3 The "Badik" Mascot 🐣

- [ ] Community names
- [ ] Logo design
- [ ] Swag / Stickers

---

## Phase 4: AI Native Features (Month 3)

### 4.1 Green AI Optimization

- [ ] Auto-optimize ebade definitions for minimum token count.
- [ ] Carbon offset calculations per line of code.

### 4.2 Multi-Agent Orchestration

- [ ] System for multiple agents to collaborate on a single ebade file synchronously.

## Success Metrics (3 Months)

| Metric | Target | Current | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Token Savings | >70% | ~70% | ✅ |
| Carbon Saved | >100kg | TBD | 🔄 |
| Framework Targets | 3 | 1 | 🔄 |
| Community Size | 1,000 "Badiks" | 0 | 🔜 |

---

## Current Status

### Phase 1 - Foundation (Nearly Complete)

The MCP server is live. CLI has premium UX. Two comprehensive examples (E-commerce + SaaS Dashboard) are ready. AI agents can now use ebade to scaffold full Next.js apps with **~70% fewer tokens**.
