> **Less tokens. Less compute. Less carbon. The Essence of Code.**

## 🌎 The Hidden Cost of AI Coding

Every token an AI generates requires:
- ⚡ **GPU Compute Cycles**: High-intensity processing in data centers.
- 🔥 **Energy Consumption**: Massive amounts of electricity.
- 🌫️ **Carbon Emissions**: The direct environmental footprint of digital growth.

**When an AI writes 1,000 tokens of boilerplate code, it's not free for the planet.** 🌍

## 📊 The Numbers

### Token Reduction = Carbon Reduction (1,000,000 sessions)

| Framework | Tokens (Estimated) | Relative Compute | CO2 Footprint |
|-----------|------------------|------------------|---------------|
| Next.js   | 539,000,000      | 100%             | ~26.9 kg      |
| Vue.js    | 420,000,000      | ~78%             | ~21.0 kg      |
| **ebade** | **185,000,000**  | **34%**          | **~9.2 kg**   |

**ebade uses 70% less compute for the same output.** 🌱

## 🌳 Environmental Impact Guide

Based on our benchmarks, switching to **ebade** for AI agent workflows saves:

- **17.7 kg CO2** per million sessions.
- Equivalent to the carbon sequestered by **~1 young tree** every 5 million sessions.
- Equivalent to driving **~70 km** in a gasoline car.

## 🧠 The Efficiency Philosophy

Traditional frameworks are human-centric. They require the AI to write huge amounts of "how" code (boilerplate, imports, setup). **ebade** uses a hybrid approach to eliminate this waste.

```text
1. Offline Architect (Local):  0 Tokens  → Handles all boilerplate & structure.
2. Online Engineer (Agent):    Low Tokens → Handles only specific business logic.
```

**Same result. Fraction of the energy.**
